Project Title:Resilient Routing Of Circuits In Networks

Group Member:NUERAILI	, Yuan XinQi	, Chang Yushuo ,	Wang YuSi	, Fan XiaoFeng

Main idea 1.1ï¼š
1. Check online material to determine the basic attributes of resilient routing.
2. Determine the relevant mathematical formula.
3. Based on the online material and the project coding structure structure from professor to simulate the network.
4. Run the data to analyze (Key question:at most h primary paths can share the same link.----->How much the parameters influence the solution?)
